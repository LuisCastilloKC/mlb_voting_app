            <h1> About Baseball </h1>
            <div>
            <ul>Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, typically of nine players each, 
                that take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called 
                the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective 
                of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players 
                to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". 
                The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to 
                prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home 
                plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.
                
                The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on the batting team who reaches first 
                base without being called "out" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' 
                turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners "out", which forces them out of the field 
                of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back a
                nd forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn 
                batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of 
                runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no 
                game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.</ul>
